    "The bag-of-words model provides a method to extract from a text a very, very rough approximation of its meaning.\n",
    "But the techniques it uses are much more general than that and can also be used to develop *grammars* - a system for separating well-formed from ill-formed utterances.\n",
    "A grammar is an indispensable part of most language models.\n",
    "Obviously a chatbot should not say gibberish, and a speech recognition model should not entertain *knzfr* as a possible English word you might have uttered a moment ago.\n",
    "So some kind of grammar model is needed for most applications, but it does not necessarily have to be a very accurate model.\n",
    "Just like the bag-of-words model is an impoverished model of meaning, the grammars we will see in this unit involve numerous simplifications compared to the implicit knowledge native speakers have about the rules of their language.\n",
    "But it is nonetheless possible to get a surprising amount of work done with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bag-of-Sounds Models and Word-Final Devoicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Every language has its own set of rules, and these rules affect all kinds of areas: the shape and pronunciation of words, how words can be built from other words, how sentences may be organized and how they may be interpreted, and much more.\n",
    "As a concrete example, let us consider the *German devoicing rule*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds can be distinguished based on whether they are *voiced* or *voiceless*.\n",
    "When a speaker utters a voiced sound, their vocal cords vibrate, giving the sounds a humming-like quality.\n",
    "Examples of voiced sounds in English are *z* in *zeal* and *v* in *vault*.\n",
    "A voiceless sound lacks the vibration of the vocal cords and thus sounds more like a hiss.\n",
    "English examples include *s* in *seal* and *f* in *fault*.\n",
    "Whereas English is fairly liberal in its use of voiced and voiceless sounds, German enforces an additional rule: no voiced sound may occur at the end of a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "    The German word for *read* is *lesen*.\n",
    "    The *s* in *lesen* is voiced.\n",
    "    Using English orthography, we could write it as *lezen*.\n",
    "    The imperative form of *lesen* is *lies*.\n",
    "    But in the imperative, the *s* is voiceless rather than voiced.\n",
    "    This is because the *s* now occurs at the end of the word, and German does not allow any voiced sounds to occur in this position.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "How could we go about specifying the German devoicing rule in a mathematically rigorous fashion?\n",
    "Well, whatever formalization we choose, it should have the effect of forbidding all words that end in a voiced sound, and only those.\n",
    "The $n$-gram bag-of-words model can actually take us a fair bit towards this goal.\n",
    "Consider the word *lies*, pronounced [liːs] (\"lees\").\n",
    "If we treat it as a string over a fixed set of sounds, we can use a bigram bag-of-words model to extract all sound bigrams: *li:* and *i:s*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on, you might object that this is no longer a bag-of-words model but rather a bag-of-sounds model.\n",
    "You are correct, but remember how we defined the function for the bag-of-words model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "b_n: \\Sigma^* \\rightarrow \\wp(\\Sigma^n) \\text{ with } t \\mapsto \\setof{ g \\mid t = u \\tuplecat g \\tuplecat v, \\text{ where } g \\in \\Sigma^n \\text{ and } u,v \\in \\Sigma^*}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We said that $\\Sigma$ is some fixed set of words, but nothing really hinges on that.\n",
    "If we take $\\Sigma$ to be a set of sounds instead, the function still behaves the same except that it now operates over smaller objects.\n",
    "Mathematically, it does not really matter what kind of objects we take to be collected in $\\Sigma$.\n",
    "If $\\Sigma$ is a set of words, $b_n$ is a model for extracting word $n$-grams from texts.\n",
    "If $\\Sigma$ is a set of sounds, $b_n$ is a model for extracting sound $n$-grams from words.\n",
    "The difference is in what the function is used for, not in what the function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us return to [li:s] and its bigrams *li:* and *i:s*, then.\n",
    "From these bigrams we can already tell that [li:s] does not violate the German devoicing rule, simply because it does not contain any voiced sounds to begin with.\n",
    "But what about *lesen*, pronounced [le:zn]?\n",
    "Its set of bigrams contains *le:*, *e:z*, and *zn*.\n",
    "While there is a voiced *z* at the end of *e:z*, it is also apparent from *zn* that this *z* does not occur at the end of a word.\n",
    "So again we can infer from the bigrams that the word does not violate the German ban against word-final voiced sounds.\n",
    "Finally, consider the ill-formed [li:z].\n",
    "Its set of bigrams consist of *li:* and *i:z*.\n",
    "Since there is no bigram that starts with *z*, the *z* in *i:z* must be word-final and thus we have a violation of the German devoicing rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our results so far suggest that $b_2$ in its current can recognize whether a word violates the German devoicing rule.\n",
    "But now consider the German word for *buttocks*, which is *Gesäß* [geze:s].\n",
    "Its ill-formed counterpart with word-final voicing would be [geze:z].\n",
    "The bigrams for this word are *ge*, *ez*, *ze:*, and *e:z*.\n",
    "While we can still infer that the word must contain at least two occurrences of *z*, it is no longer clear whether one of them is word-final.\n",
    "To see this more clearly, ask yourself the following: does the set of bigrams change if we add another [e:] at the end of the word?\n",
    "The answer is no - both [geze:z] and [geze:ze:] contain only the bigrams *ge*, *ez*, *ze:*, but the former violates the devoicing rule whereas the latter obeys it.\n",
    "The bigrams of a string cannot tell us reliably whether a sound occurs in word-final position, and consequently $b_2$ cannot be used to reliably determine whether a word violates the devoicing rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Augmented Strings and Strictly Local Grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with $b_2$, or in fact, any $b_n$ is that decomposing a word into its $n$-grams destroys the information about which sounds occur at the beginning and the end of the word.\n",
    "In some cases like the illicit [li:z] we can reconstruct this information from indirect evidence, but this isn't always possible.\n",
    "However, as mathematically savvy language scientists we are free to come up with a formal device that will allow us to preserve this information.\n",
    "And our solution can be very blunt: we can explictly mark the left and right edge of a word with the special symbols $\\LeftEdge$ and $\\RightEdge$ before we extract the bigrams with $b_2$.\n",
    "So the input for $b_2$ isn't *geze:z*, it is *$\\LeftEdge$geze:z$\\RightEdge$*.\n",
    "The bigrams of this word are\n",

    "And all of that just to forbid voiced sounds at the end?\n",
    "We could have had that a lot more easily: the *German devoicing checker* function $d: \\Sigma^* \\rightarrow \\setof{\\top, \\bot}$ maps every string $s$ to $\\top$ unless $s \\in \\Sigma^* \\times \\setof{\\text{v}, \\text{z}}$.\n",
    "There, just one function, and one that is easily defined within a single line.\n",
    "No augmented strings, no grammars, just a clean formalization of the German ban against voiced sounds at the end of a word.\n",
    "So, what gives?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true that German devoicing can be described very easily with a single function.\n",
    "But this isn't the point of what we are doing here.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we wanted to see how the mathematical machinery of the bag-of-words model can be extended to a very different domain.\n",
    "Intuitively, it is rather surprising that a model for the meaning of texts can also be used to regulate the shape of words.\n",

    "Some languages put *long-distance* restrictions on the distribution of sounds.\n",
    "For example, in Samala and Navajo word may contain either *s* or *ʃ*, but not both (the ʃ symbol represents the *sh* sound in words like *shoe* or *wish*).\n",
    "It does no matter how far apart the two sounds are, it is simply not allowed for both of them to occur in the same word.\n",

    "But then of course we also need the mirror version $\\text{ʃ} u_1 u_2 u_3 u_4 u_5 u_6 u_7 u_8 u_9 \\text{s}$, as well as variants like $u_1 u_2 u_3 \\text{s} u_4 u_5 u_6 u_7 u_8 u_9 \\text{ʃ}$ or $u_1 \\text{s} u_2 u_3 u_4 u_5 \\text{ʃ} u_6 u_7 u_8 u_9$.\n",
    "In sum, the simple ban against *s* and *ʃ* in the same word would require $9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 3^9 = 1,417,176$ distinct $11$-grams (and that's still assuming the unrealistic bound of at most three different sound values for each $u_i$).\n",
